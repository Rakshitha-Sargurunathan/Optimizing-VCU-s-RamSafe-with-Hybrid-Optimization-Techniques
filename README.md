# Optimizing-VCU-s-RamSafe-with-Hybrid-Optimization-Techniques
This project explores the use of hybrid optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of Virginia Commonwealth University's (VCU) RamSafe, an on-demand evening transportation service.

## Overview
This project proposes a hybrid optimization approach to improve VCU's RamSafe shuttle service by integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. The goal is to reduce wait times, optimize vehicle routing, and lower operational costs while ensuring an efficient transportation service for students and staff.

## Key Objectives:
* Reduce student wait times by improving real-time route optimization
* Enhance vehicle utilization to decrease overall operational costs
* Leverage historical and real-time data to optimize dispatching decisions
* Align with VCU's sustainability goals by reducing fuel consumption
  
## Methodology:
* Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): Used to adapt shuttle routes dynamically based on real-time data such as GPS locations, passenger demand, and traffic patterns.
* IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio: Applied to ensure adherence to system constraints, optimize scheduling, and maximize operational efficiency.
* Hybrid Approach: DRL optimizes dynamic decisions, while CPLEX ensures efficient resource allocation.

## Expected Outcomes:
* Shorter wait times for students using RamSafe
* Reduced operational costs through optimized fleet management
* Improved on-time performance and enhanced service reliability
* Lower environmental impact due to decreased fuel consumption
